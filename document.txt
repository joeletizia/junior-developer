# How to be a Junior Developer

Over the past year, I've been working to find and being employed in my first true '9-5' programming job. It has been an incredible experience and one that I'll never forget. The process of landing my first job was one of the hardest things I've had to do. Actually working at the job has been even harder, but so incredibly rewarding that I wanted to share my experiences in order to help more people gain employment in software development. 

### It's not Personal : It's Business

Being a junior developer is hard. The profession is difficult on its own, but if you also consider that many software development shops have brutally honest performance feedback schemes, it begins to seem that no one is truly cut out to be a software developer. This is obviously not the case. Hearing where you need work and what you're lacking is tough on anybody. Learning how to embrace the feedback, and not looking at it as a personal attack is essential, and a key sign that you are willing to grow personally. 

You will receive tons of feeback as you begin to interview for your first position. Every offer and rejection you receive will certainly help mold you into a better developer. Any and all feeback is important; remember it. A good tactic is to keep a record of all of your interviews. Use a google docs spreadsheet to record things like: 

* Date
* Company name
* Interviewer names
* Interview format (white board, pairing, puzzles)
* Impressions on the company process both positive and negative
* Culture
* Offer details should it go well
* Feedback received from interviewers

### Embrace your CS Fundamentals

The first key to becoming a developer is landing a job. For most, the route generally begins with your first job out of college. Thus begins the discussion on the dreaded programming interview. Some companies have ridiculous puzzles about finding a close approximation of how many grains of sand are on the Earth (you probably don't want to work here), other companies will ask your questions about data-structures and algorithms and have you sketch out solutions on a whiteboard, while others will sit you down next to a team member and work on a project out of their backlog. Regardless of how the interview is done, the one constant through all of them will most likely necessitate fundamental Computer Scienece knowledge. Things like basic data structures and algorithms and object oriented design are essential in most interviews. 

For a junior position, places outside of Google and Facebook aren't going to probe you for concepts that you didn't learn in school. However, you'll certainly want to be able to explain in what situations a certain data structure is more advantageous over another.

I've been shopping around for data structures books for a few months. It seems that there is almost a unanimous consensus for Introduction to Algorithms (also known as the CLRS after the authors) to be the de facto standard. To this point, I find myself to be in agreement with those that gave it such high praise. A general understanding of all the points in the text should be a great stepping stone for even seasoned developers.

### Attitude is Everything

The attitude with which you approach your position is (at some companies) more important than the state of your current skill set. If you are difficult to work with, have an abrasive personality, or are in some other way incapable of being a part of a team, your skill set can become inconsequential. 

Don't be affraid of not being the best developer on your team. The people I work with code circles around me on a daily basis. However, you can still be a contributing member of a team as long as you have a good attitude and are continually progressing. 

On my current team, we use a somewhat unique approach to interviewing. It's strikingly simpleâ€¦ but the fact remains that it is unique none-the-less. We simply invite candidates that pass a phone screen to complete a simple pair programming exercise with one of our developers using test-driven-development. There are no tricks, no riddles, and no counting grains of sand. This gives us two data points:

1. Whether or not they have enough of a background in data structures and algorithms.
2. Whether or not they personable enough to work in a team to accomplish a common task. 

We tend to keep it to an hour in order to save the candidate time because the next round is a full day of pairing with 2-3 of our developers. The interview is tagging along with your partner and tackling real features out of our backlog. This process is as much a technical assessment as it is a deep dive into the candidates attitude. Having an inquisitive personality, a calm yet up beat demeanor, and even a sense of humor are all things that employers are looking for in their junior hires. If this sounds a bit like blind dating, you're not too far off. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't be assertive, however. One thing that may help people stand out is having a set of opinions on best practices that you've developed over the course of your experience. Being able to express these opinions in a way that is both assertive and well mannered is a great combination. By doing that, you've shown that you not only have good skills, but can be a great teammate.

### Write Some Code

Most universities do a fine job teaching theoretical Computer Science. A good base in Computer Scienece is essential in your professional career. However, being introduced to the more practical problems you will see in your day-to-day professional career is also essential. A great way to do that is to have a side project. Apply what you are learning in your classes to something that you can get behind. If you are into finance, write a small application that does some analysis on several securities to find correlations. If you find you have an interest in gaming, create a few graphics programs in OpenGL. If you are passionate about web development, create a web application to handle your personal blog. There are many things that you can apply your course work to while at the same time learning the necessary tools that make up our trade as software developers.

In any non-trivial project you will want to set up a version control system which will allow you to track the changes you make to your code as you add more and more features to your project. Git + GitHub is a pefect choice for this. GitHub allows you to share your code with others if you desire, access your repository from many machines, and uses git under the hood which has become quite prevalent in the version control systems market. 

### Learn to Interview

Interviewing is like writing code, playing soccer, or riding a bicycle; they all take practice to become proficient. Once you have some experience under your belt, take a stab at applying to a few companies. Make sure to have your resume or other application material looked over by a friend. Remember that side project you did? List it! Put a link to your github on your resume! If you spent a significant amount of time on it and you can explain the strengths and weaknesses of the code you wrote eloquently, you are *way* ahead of the game. 

Your first few interviews will most likely not go well. You will probably get flustered when asked to whiteboard code or pair program. This is fine, it takes some getting used to. After a while, you'll learn how to use the appropriate amount of space on the white board, how to elegantly state why you are using one algorithm or data structure over another, and how to present yourself as a overall well adjusted human being.
